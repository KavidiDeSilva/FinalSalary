# FinalSalary
Challenge 5

This Java program calculates the final salary of an employee based on their basic salary, daily payment, and number of working days. It uses multithreading to calculate the allowances and EPF contributions separately, and then adds them to the basic salary to get the final salary.

To use the program, simply run it and enter the payment per day and number of days when prompted. The program will then output the basic salary, allowances, EPF contribution, and final salary.

This program can be useful in various payroll systems where the calculation of allowances and EPF contributions needs to be done separately and concurrently.
